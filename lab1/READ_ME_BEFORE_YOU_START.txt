Hej from Davide!


The six Jupyter notebooks in this folder correspond to the six exercises in lab 1 (see https://canvas.kth.se/courses/52204/files/8962262?wrap=1 ). You may ignore the folder named "check".
Feel free to use the six notebooks to solve the exercises. You may also add new Markdown sections to write your comments in clear text. Note: TeX formatting is supported!
If you do that, you can simply hand in just the notebooks through Canvas as a way to submit your solutions!


If needed, here's a tutorial on how to use Jupyter notebooks: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/ . And here's a tutorial on numerics programming in Python using NumPy: https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html .


In many cases, templates have been provided for you to add your own code. Feel free to disregard them if you'd rather organize your code in a different way.

In some cases, I've also included code sections that start with the line "# check your implementation of ...".
In these sections, I've coded a simple comparison between results obtained with your code and results I've obtained with my own implementation. I hope these help you with debugging! Of course, if you've decided to ignore the templates that I've provided you, these comparisons may fail spectacularly.


Enjoy and good luck!
